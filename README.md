# svelte w/ fastify app

This is a project template for [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) apps. It lives at https://github.com/sveltejs/template.


## Get started

Remix this app on Glitch and you should be ready to go!

When Glitch runs `npm run build`, this app uses rollup to package everything.

When `npm run start` is run, this app uses [Fastify](https://www.fastify.io/) in `server.js` to serve the static site.
